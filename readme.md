#Átila Fassina's personal resumé

This is the source code for the app-like version of my resumé.
Luckily developers won't be needing PDF text-like boring resumés and instead of TELLING our skills we could just use them to speak for themselves, that would save a lot of time for employers -and why not say: for us also!.

So, go ahead and take a look at my idea of a responsive resumé and fork if you want.
